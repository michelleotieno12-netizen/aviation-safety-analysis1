# Aviation Safety Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes historical aviation accident data to identify lower-risk aircraft for commercial and private aviation operations.

## Business Understanding
Our company is expanding into aviation and must identify aircraft with the lowest operational risk to guide purchasing decisions.

## Data
Source: National Transportation Safety Board (1962–2023)

## Analysis
Exploratory data analysis, aggregation, and visualization were used to identify trends and risk factors.

## Conclusion
This analysis provides three actionable recommendations to guide aircraft acquisition decisions.


## Business Understanding

The company is expanding into the aviation industry and needs to make informed decisions about which aircraft to purchase and operate. Aviation accidents carry significant safety, legal, and financial risks, and leadership currently lacks insight into which aircraft have historically demonstrated lower risk.

The goal of this project is to analyze aviation accident data to identify aircraft types and manufacturers associated with fewer and less severe accidents. These insights will support data-driven aircraft acquisition decisions and help minimize operational risk as the company enters the aviation market.
